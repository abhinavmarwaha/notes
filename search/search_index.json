(In this context 11 in decimal numbers is same as 3 in binary numbers) If difference between sum of odd digits and even digits is multiple of 11 then decimal number is multiple of 11. Let\u2019s see how. Let\u2019s take the example of 2 digit numbers in decimal AB = 11A -A + B = 11A + (B \u2013 A) So if (B \u2013 A) is a multiple of 11 then is AB. Let us take 3 digit numbers. ABC = 99A + A + 11B \u2013 B + C = (99A + 11B) + (A + C \u2013 B) So if (A + C \u2013 B) is a multiple of 11 then is (ABC) Let us take 4 digit numbers now.

The value of a b is same as (a 2) (b/2) if b is even, otherwise the value is same as ((a 2)*(b/2) + a). In the while loop, we keep multiplying \u2018a\u2019 with 2 and keep dividing \u2018b\u2019 by 2. If \u2018b\u2019 becomes odd in loop, we add \u2018a\u2019 to \u2018res\u2019. When value of \u2018b\u2019 becomes 1, the value of \u2018res\u2019 + \u2018a\u2019, gives us the result.

The matrix representation gives the following closed expression for the Fibonacci numbers: Time Complexity: O(n) Extra Space: O(1) int fib(int n) { int F[2][2] = {{1,1},{1,0}}; if (n == 0) return 0; power(F, n-1); return F[0][0]; } void multiply(int F[2][2], int M[2][2]) { int x = F[0][0]*M[0][0] + F[0][1]*M[1][0]; int y = F[0][0]*M[0][1] + F[0][1]*M[1][1]; int z = F[1][0]*M[0][0] + F[1][1]*M[1][0]; int w = F[1][0]*M[0][1] + F[1][1]*M[1][1]; F[0][0] = x; F[0][1] = y; F[1][0] = z; F[1][1] = w; } void power(int F[2][2], int n) { int i; int M[2][2] = {{1,1},{1,0}}; // n - 1 times multiply the matrix to {{1,0},{0,1}} for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) multiply(F, M); } Method 5 ( Optimized Method 4 ) \u00b6 The method 4 can be optimized to work in O(Logn) time complexity.

In Amortized Analysis, we analyze a sequence of operations and guarantee a worst case average time which is lower than the worst case time of a particular expensive operation. The example data structures whose operations are analyzed using Amortized Analysis are Hash Tables, Disjoint Sets and Splay Trees. Let us consider an example of a simple hash table insertions. How do we decide table size? There is a trade-off between space and time, if we make hash-table size big, search time becomes fast, but space required becomes high. Dynamic Table The solution to this trade-off problem is to use Dynamic Table (or Arrays). The idea is to increase size of table whenever it becomes full. Following are the steps to follow when table becomes full. 1) Allocate memory for a larger table of size, typically twice the old table. 2) Copy the contents of old table to new table. 3) Free the old table. If the table has space available, we simply insert new item in available space. What is the time complexity of n insertions using the above scheme? If we use simple analysis, the worst case cost of an insertion is O(n). Therefore, worst case cost of n inserts is n * O(n) which is O(n2). This analysis gives an upper bound, but not a tight upper bound for n insertions as all insertions don\u2019t take \u0398(n) time. So using Amortized Analysis, we could prove that the Dynamic Table scheme has O(1) insertion time which is a great result used in hashing. Also, the concept of dynamic table is used in vectors in C++, ArrayList in Java. Following are few important notes. 1) Amortized cost of a sequence of operations can be seen as expenses of a salaried person. The average monthly expense of the person is less than or equal to the salary, but the person can spend more money in a particular month by buying a car or something. In other months, he or she saves money for the expensive month. 2) The above Amortized Analysis done for Dynamic Array example is called Aggregate Method. There are two more powerful ways to do Amortized analysis called Accounting Method and Potential Method.

Best Case Analysis (Bogus) \u00b6 \u0398(1) Why not average? \u00b6 The average case analysis is not easy to do in most of the practical cases and it is rarely done.

For example, in the typical implementation of Quick Sort (where pivot is chosen as a corner element), the worst occurs when the input array is already sorted and the best occur when the pivot elements always divide array in two halves. For insertion sort, the worst case occurs when the array is reverse sorted and the best case occurs when the array is sorted in the same order as output.

Lower bound of an algorithm is shown by the asymptotic notation called Big Omega (or just Omega). Upper Bound \u00b6 Let U(n) be the running time of an algorithm A(say), then g(n) is the Upper Bound of A if there exist two constants C and N such that U(n) <= C*g(n) for n > N. Upper bound of an algorithm is shown by the asymptotic notation called Big Oh(O) (or just Oh). Lower Bound Theory \u00b6 According to the lower bound theory, for a lower bound L(n) of an algorithm, it is not possible to have any other algorithm (for a common problem) whose time complexity is less than L(n) for random input. Also every algorithm must take at least L(n) time in worst case. Note that L(n) here is the minimum of all the possible algorithm, of maximum complexity. The Lower Bound is a very important for any algorithm. Once we calculated it, then we can compare it with the actual complexity of the algorithm and if their order are same then we can declare our algorithm as optimal. So in this section we will be discussing about techniques for finding the lower bound of an algorithm. Note that our main motive is to get an optimal algorithm, which is the one having its Upper Bound Same as its Lower Bound (U(n)=L(n)). Merge Sort is a common example of an optimal algorithm. Trivial Lower Bound \u00b6 It is the easiest method to find the lower bound. The Lower bounds which can be easily observed on the basis of the number of input taken and the number of output produces are called Trivial Lower Bound. Multiplication of n x n matrix Input: For 2 matrix we will have 2n2 inputs Output: 1 matrix of order n x n, i.e., n2 outputs In the above example its easily predictable that the lower bound is O(n2). Computational Model The method is for all those algorithms that are comparison based. For example in sorting we have to compare the elements of the list among themselves and then sort them accordingly. Similar is the case with searching and thus we can implement the same in this case. Now we will look at some examples to understand its usage. Ordered Searching It is a type of searching in which the list is already sorted. Linear search In linear search we compare the key with first element if it does not match we compare with second element and so on till we check against the nth element. Else we will end up with a failure. Binary search In binary search, we check the middle element against the key, if it is greater we search the first half else we check the second half and repeat the same process. The diagram below there is an illustration of binary search in an array consisting of 4 elements Calculating the lower bound : The max no of comparisons are n. Let there be k levels in the tree. No. of nodes will be 2k-1 The upper bound of no of nodes in any comparison based search of an element in list of size n will be n as there are maximum of n comparisons in worst case scenario 2k-1 Each level will take 1 comparison thus no. of comparisons k\u2265|log2n| Thus the lower bound of any comparison based search from a list of n elements cannot be less than log(n). Therefore we can say that Binary Search is optimal as its complexity is \u0398(log n). Sorting The diagram below is an example of tree formed in sorting combinations with 3 elements. For n elements, finding lower bound using computation model For n elements we have a total on n! combinations (leaf nodes). (Refer the diagram the total combinations are 3! or 6) also it is clear that the tree formed is a binary tree. Each level in the diagram indicates a comparison. Let there be k levels => 2k is the total number of leaf nodes in a full binary tree thus in this case we have n!\u22642k. As the k in the above example is the no of comparisons thus by computational model lower bond = k. n!\u22642T(n) Thus, T(n)>|log n!| => n!<=nn Thus, log n!<=log nn Taking ceiling function on both sides, we get |-log nn-|>=|-log n!-| Thus complexity becomes \u0398(lognn) or \u0398(nlogn) Using Lower bond theory to solve algebraic problem: Straight Line Program The type of programs build without any loops or control structures is called Straight Line Program. For example, summing to nos Sum(a, b) { //no loops and no control structures c:= a+b; return c; } Algebraic Problem Problems related to algebra like solving equations inequalities etc., comes under algebraic problems. For example, solving equation ax2+bx+c with simple programming. Algo_Sol(a, b, c, x) { //1 assignment v:=a*x; //1 assignment v:=v+b; //1 assignment v:=v*x; //1 assignment ans:=v+c; return ans; } Complexity for solving here is 4 (excluding the returning). The above example shows us a simple way to solve an equation for 2 degree polynomial i.e., 4 thus for nth degree polynomial we will have complexity of O(n2). Let us demonstrate via an algorithm. anxn+an-1xn-1+an-2xn-2+\u2026+a1x+a0 is a polynomial of degree n. pow(x, n) { p := 1; //loop from 1 to n for i:=1 to n p := p*x; return p; } polynomial(A, x, n) { int p, v:=0; for i := 0 to n //loop within a loop from 0 to n v := v + A[i]*pow(x, i); return v; } Loop within a loop => complexity = O(n^2); Now to find an optimal algorithm we need to find the lower bound here (as per lower bound theory). As per Lower Bound Theory, The optimal algorithm to solve the above problem is the one having complexity O(n). Lets prove this theorem using lower bounds. To prove that optimal algo of solving a n degree polynomial is O(n) Proof: The best solution for reducing the algo is to make this problem less complex by dividing the polynomial into several straight line problems. => anxn+an-1xn-1+an-2xn-2+...+a1x+a0 can be written as, ((..(anx+an-1)x+..+a2)x+a1)x+a0 Now, algorithm will be as, v=0 v=v+an v=v*x v=v+an-1 v=v*x v=v+a1 v=v*x v=v+a0 polynomial(A, x, n) { int p, v=0; // loop executed n times for i = n to 0 v = (v + A[i])*x; return v; } Clearly, the complexity of this code is O(n).

Computational Model The method is for all those algorithms that are comparison based. For example in sorting we have to compare the elements of the list among themselves and then sort them accordingly. Similar is the case with searching and thus we can implement the same in this case. Now we will look at some examples to understand its usage. Ordered Searching It is a type of searching in which the list is already sorted. Linear search In linear search we compare the key with first element if it does not match we compare with second element and so on till we check against the nth element. Else we will end up with a failure. Binary search In binary search, we check the middle element against the key, if it is greater we search the first half else we check the second half and repeat the same process.

It has a set of states and rules for moving from one state to another but it depends upon the applied input symbol. Basically it is an abstract model pf digital computer. simplest machine to recognize patterns Q : Finite set of states. \u03a3 : set of Input Symbols. q : Initial state. F : set of Final States. \u03b4 : Transition Function. { Q, \u03a3, q, F, \u03b4 } Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) \u00b6 DFA consists of 5 tuples {Q, \u03a3, q, F, \u03b4}. Q : set of all states. \u03a3 : set of input symbols. ( Symbols which machine takes as input ) q : Initial state. ( Starting state of a machine ) F : set of final state. \u03b4 : Transition Function, defined as \u03b4 : Q X \u03a3 --> Q. In a DFA, for a particular input character, the machine goes to one state only. A transition function is defined on every state for every input symbol. Also in DFA null (or \u03b5) move is not allowed, i.e., DFA cannot change state without any input character. For example, below DFA with \u03a3 = {0, 1} accepts all strings ending with 0. One important thing to note is, there can be many possible DFAs for a pattern. A DFA with minimum number of states is generally preferred. Nondeterministic Finite Automata(NFA) \u00b6 NFA is similar to DFA except following additional features: Null (or \u03b5) move is allowed i.e., it can move forward without reading symbols. Ability to transmit to any number of states for a particular input. However, these above features don\u2019t add any power to NFA. If we compare both in terms of power, both are equivalent. Due to above additional features, NFA has a different transition function, rest is same as DFA. \u03b4: Transition Function \u03b4: Q X (\u03a3 U \u03b5 ) --> 2 ^ Q. As you can see in transition function is for any input including null (or \u03b5), NFA can go to any state number of states. For example, below is a NFA for above problem One important thing to note is, in NFA, if any path for an input string leads to a final state, then the input string accepted. For example, in above NFA, there are multiple paths for input string \u201c00\u201d. Since, one of the paths leads to a final state, \u201c00\u201d is accepted by above NFA. Some Important Points: Justification: Since all the tuples in DFA and NFA are the same except for one of the tuples, which is Transition Function (\u03b4) In case of DFA \u03b4 : Q X \u03a3 --> Q In case of NFA \u03b4 : Q X \u03a3 --> 2Q Now if you observe you\u2019ll find out Q X \u03a3 \u2013> Q is part of Q X \u03a3 \u2013> 2Q. In the RHS side, Q is the subset of 2Q which indicates Q is contained in 2Q or Q is a part of 2Q, however, the reverse isn\u2019t true. So mathematically, we can conclude that every DFA is NFA but not vice-versa. Yet there is a way to convert an NFA to DFA, so there exists an equivalent DFA for every NFA.

In a DFA, for a particular input character, the machine goes to one state only. A transition function is defined on every state for every input symbol. Also in DFA null (or \u03b5) move is not allowed, i.e., DFA cannot change state without any input character. For example, below DFA with \u03a3 = {0, 1} accepts all strings ending with 0. One important thing to note is, there can be many possible DFAs for a pattern. A DFA with minimum number of states is generally preferred.","title":"Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)"},{"location":"algo/misc/automata.html#nondeterministic-finite-automatanfa","text":"NFA is similar to DFA except following additional features: Null (or \u03b5) move is allowed i.e., it can move forward without reading symbols. Ability to transmit to any number of states for a particular input. However, these above features don\u2019t add any power to NFA. If we compare both in terms of power, both are equivalent. Due to above additional features, NFA has a different transition function, rest is same as DFA. \u03b4: Transition Function \u03b4: Q X (\u03a3 U \u03b5 ) --> 2 ^ Q. As you can see in transition function is for any input including null (or \u03b5), NFA can go to any state number of states. For example, below is a NFA for above problem One important thing to note is, in NFA, if any path for an input string leads to a final state, then the input string accepted. For example, in above NFA, there are multiple paths for input string \u201c00\u201d. Since, one of the paths leads to a final state, \u201c00\u201d is accepted by above NFA. Some Important Points: Justification: Since all the tuples in DFA and NFA are the same except for one of the tuples, which is Transition Function (\u03b4) In case of DFA \u03b4 : Q X \u03a3 --> Q In case of NFA \u03b4 : Q X \u03a3 --> 2Q Now if you observe you\u2019ll find out Q X \u03a3 \u2013> Q is part of Q X \u03a3 \u2013> 2Q. In the RHS side, Q is the subset of 2Q which indicates Q is contained in 2Q or Q is a part of 2Q, however, the reverse isn\u2019t true. So mathematically, we can conclude that every DFA is NFA but not vice-versa. Yet there is a way to convert an NFA to DFA, so there exists an equivalent DFA for every NFA. Both NFA and DFA have same power and each NFA can be translated into a DFA. There can be multiple final states in both DFA and NFA. NFA is more of a theoretical concept.

The idea of caching the useful data centers around a fundamental property of computer programs known as locality. Programs with good locality tend to access the same set of data items over and over again from the upper levels of the memory hierarchy (i.e. cache) and thus run faster. Example: The run time of different matrix multiplication kernels that perform the same number of arithmetic operations, but have different degrees of locality, can vary by a factor of 20! Types of Locality \u00b6 Temporal locality : Temporal locality states that, the same data objects are likely to be reused multiple times by the CPU during the execution of a program Spatial locality : It states that if a data object is referenced once, then there is a high probability that it\u2019s neighbor data objects will also be referenced in near future. Importance of Locality \u00b6 In operating systems, the principle of locality allows the system to use main memory as a cache of the most recently referenced chunk of virtual address space and also in case of recently used disk blocks in disk file systems. Cache Friendly Code \u00b6 Frequently used cases need to be faster : Programs often invest most of the time in a few core functions and these functions in return have most to do with the loops. So, these loops should be designed in a way that they possess a good locality. Multiple loops : If a program constitutes of multiple loops then minimize the cache misses in the inner loop to alleviate the performance of the code. eg \u00b6 Row major: \u00b6 int sumarrayrows(int a[8][4]) { int i, j, sum = 0; for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) for (j = 0; j < 4; j++) sum += a[i][j]; return sum; } c -> row major storing of 2 dimensional array. cache hit -> 75 % in block size of 4 words each.

Otherwise, traverse up to maintain heap property. delete(): Deleting a key We replace the key to be deleted with minum infinite by calling decreaseKey(). After decreaseKey(), the minus infinite value must reach root, so we call extractMin() to remove the key. Application \u00b6 Heap Sort : Heap Sort uses Binary Heap to sort an array in O(nLogn) time. Priority Queue : Priority queues can be efficiently implemented using Binary Heap because it supports insert(), delete() and extractmax(), decreaseKey() operations in O(logn) time. Binomoial Heap and Fibonacci Heap are variations of Binary Heap. These variations perform union also efficiently. Graph Algorithms : priority queues -> Dijkstra\u2019s Shortest Path, Prim\u2019s Minimum Spanning Tree. 5. a. K\u2019th Largest Element in an array. b. Sort an almost sorted array / Merge K Sorted Arrays. Why is Binary Heap Preferred over BST for Priority Queue? \u00b6 A typical Priority Queue requires following operations to be efficient. Get Top Priority Element (Get minimum or maximum) Insert an element Remove top priority element Decrease Key A Binary Heap supports above operations with following time complexities: O(1) O(Logn) O(Logn) O(Logn) A Self Balancing Binary Search Tree like AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc can also support above operations with same time complexities. Finding minimum and maximum are not naturally O(1), but can be easily implemented in O(1) by keeping an extra pointer to minimum or maximum and updating the pointer with insertion and deletion if required. With deletion we can update by finding inorder predecessor or successor. Inserting an element is naturally O(Logn) Removing maximum or minimum are also O(Logn) Decrease key can be done in O(Logn) by doing a deletion followed by insertion. So why is Binary Heap Preferred for Priority Queue? arrays-> locallity of refernence -> cache friendliness constants in Binary Search Tree are higher. constructing Binary Heap -> O(n) Self Balancing BSTs -> O(nLogn) Binary Heap doesn\u2019t require extra space for pointers. Binary Heap is easier to implement. TFibonacci Heap -> insert and decrease-key -> \u0398(1) time Is Binary Heap always better? Although Binary Heap is for Priority Queue, BSTs have their own advantages and the list of advantages is in-fact bigger compared to binary heap. Searching an element in self-balancing BST is O(Logn) which is O(n) in Binary Heap. We can print all elements of BST in sorted order in O(n) time, but Binary Heap requires O(nLogn) time. Floor and ceil can be found in O(Logn) time.

When the Java compiler compiles certain constructs, such as inner classes, it creates synthetic constructs; these are classes, methods, fields, and other constructs that do not have a corresponding construct in the source code. Synthetic constructs enable Java compilers to implement new Java language features without changes to the JVM. However, synthetic constructs can vary among different Java compiler implementations, which means that .class files can vary among different implementations as well. Consequently, you may have compatibility issues if you serialize an inner class and then deserialize it with a different JRE implementation. See the section Implicit and Synthetic Parameters in the section Obtaining Names of Method Parameters for more information about the synthetic constructs generated when an inner class is compiled. Local and Anonymous Classes \u00b6 There are two additional types of inner classes. You can declare an inner class within the body of a method. These classes are known as local classes. You can also declare an inner class within the body of a method without naming the class. These classes are known as anonymous classes. import javafx.event.ActionEvent; import javafx.event.EventHandler; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.scene.control.Button; import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane; import javafx.stage.Stage; public class HelloWorld extends Application { public static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); } @Override public void start(Stage primaryStage) { primaryStage.setTitle(\"Hello World!\"); Button btn = new Button(); btn.setText(\"Say 'Hello World'\"); btn.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() { @Override public void handle(ActionEvent event) { System.out.println(\"Hello World!\"); } }); StackPane root = new StackPane(); root.getChildren().add(btn); primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 300, 250)); primaryStage.show(); } } Lambda Expressions \u00b6 p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE && p.getAge() >= 18 && p.getAge() <= 25 Ideall use cases: Field Description Name Perform action on selected members Primary Actor Administrator Preconditions Administrator is logged in to the system.

Serialization \u00b6 When to Use which \u00b6 As mentioned in the section Nested Classes, nested classes enable you to logically group classes that are only used in one place, increase the use of encapsulation, and create more readable and maintainable code. Local classes, anonymous classes, and lambda expressions also impart these advantages; however, they are intended to be used for more specific situations: Local class: Use it if you need to create more than one instance of a class, access its constructor, or introduce a new, named type (because, for example, you need to invoke additional methods later). Anonymous class: Use it if you need to declare fields or additional methods. Lambda expression: Use it if you are encapsulating a single unit of behavior that you want to pass to other code. For example, you would use a lambda expression if you want a certain action performed on each element of a collection, when a process is completed, or when a process encounters an error. Use it if you need a simple instance of a functional interface and none of the preceding criteria apply (for example, you do not need a constructor, a named type, fields, or additional methods). Nested class: Use it if your requirements are similar to those of a local class, you want to make the type more widely available, and you don't require access to local variables or method parameters. Use a non-static nested class (or inner class) if you require access to an enclosing instance's non-public fields and methods. Use a static nested class if you don't require this access.

Two basic units of execution: Processes Threads In java, we mainly deal with threads. Processing time for a single core is shared among processes and threads through an OS feature called time slicing . Process \u00b6 A process has a self-contained execution environment. (A complete, private set of basic run-time resources: memory space atleast) An application is a set of processes comunicating with each other. OS support Inter Process Communication (IPC) resources, such as pipes and sockets. Most programs in JVM run as a single process, if you want multiple processes extend ProcessBuilder . Threads \u00b6 lightweight processes (lower resource requirement) Threads share the process's resources, including memory and open files. This makes for efficient, but potentially problematic, communication. Thread Objects \u00b6 2 basic strategies for using Thread objects to create a concurrent application: To directly control thread creation and management, simply instantiate Thread each time the application needs to initiate an asynchronous task. To abstract thread management from the rest of your application, pass the application's tasks to an executor . Defination \u00b6 Thread must provide the code that will run in that thread. Provide a Runnable object. This approach more flexible and it is applicable to the high-level thread management APIs. public class HelloRunnable implements Runnable { public void run() { System.out.println(\"Hello from a thread!\"); } public static void main(String args[]) { (new Thread(new HelloRunnable())).start(); } } Subclass Thread. The Thread class itself implements Runnable, though its run method does nothing The Thread class defines a number of methods useful for thread management. public class HelloThread extends Thread { public void run() { System.out.println(\"Hello from a thread!\"); } public static void main(String args[]) { (new HelloThread()).start(); } } Operations \u00b6 Sleep \u00b6 public class SleepMessages { public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException { String importantInfo[] = { \"Mares eat oats\", \"Does eat oats\", \"Little lambs eat ivy\", \"A kid will eat ivy too\" }; for (int i = 0; i < importantInfo.length; i++) { Thread.sleep(4000); System.out.println(importantInfo[i]); } } } Interrupts \u00b6 An interrupt is an indication to a thread that it should stop what it is doing and do something else. for (int i = 0; i < importantInfo.length; i++) { // Pause for 4 seconds try { Thread.sleep(4000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { // We've been interrupted: no more messages. return; } // Print a message System.out.println(importantInfo[i]); } for (int i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) { heavyCrunch(inputs[i]); if (Thread.interrupted()) { // We've been interrupted: no more crunching. return; } } if (Thread.interrupted()) { throw new InterruptedException(); } The Interrupt Status Flag Invoking Thread.interrupt sets this flag. When a thread checks for an interrupt by invoking the static method Thread.interrupted, interrupt status is cleared. The non-static isInterrupted method, which is used by one thread to query the interrupt status of another, does not change the interrupt status flag. Joins \u00b6 Join method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another t.join(); Causes the current thread to pause execution until t's thread terminates Overloads of join allow the programmer to specify a waiting period. However, as with sleep, join is dependent on the OS for timing The Simple Thread \u00b6 public class SimpleThreads { static void threadMessage(String message) { String threadName = Thread.currentThread().getName(); System.out.format(\"%s: %s%n\", threadName, message); } private static class MessageLoop implements Runnable { public void run() { String importantInfo[] = { \"Mares eat oats\", \"Does eat oats\", \"Little lambs eat ivy\", \"A kid will eat ivy too\" }; try { for (int i = 0; i < importantInfo.length; i++) { Thread.sleep(4000); threadMessage(importantInfo[i]); } } catch (InterruptedException e) { threadMessage(\"I wasn't done!\"); } } } public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException { long patience = 1000 * 60 * 60; if (args.length > 0) { try { patience = Long.parseLong(args[0]) * 1000; } catch (NumberFormatException e) { System.err.println(\"Argument must be an integer.\"); System.exit(1); } } threadMessage(\"Starting MessageLoop thread\"); long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); Thread t = new Thread(new MessageLoop()); t.start(); threadMessage(\"Waiting for MessageLoop thread to finish\"); while (t.isAlive()) { threadMessage(\"Still waiting...\"); t.join(1000); if (((System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime) > patience) && t.isAlive()) { threadMessage(\"Tired of waiting!\"); t.interrupt(); t.join(); } } threadMessage(\"Finally!\"); } } The main thread creates a new thread from the Runnable object, MessageLoop, and waits for it to finish. If the MessageLoop thread takes too long to finish, the main thread interrupts it. Synchronisation \u00b6 Threads communicate primarily by sharing access to fields and the objects reference fields refer to. Problems: Thread interference Memory consistency errors Synchronisation solves it but a problem of thread contention (Starvation, Livelock etc) arises, which occurs when two or more threads try to access the same resource simultaneously and cause the Java runtime to execute one or more threads more slowly, or even suspend their execution. two basic synchronization idioms: synchronized methods synchronized statements. Thread Interference \u00b6 Interference happens when two operations, running in different threads, but acting on the same data, interleave. The single expression c++ can be decomposed into: Retrieve the current value of c. Increment it by 1. Store the value back in c. eg. Thread A: Retrieve c. Thread B: Retrieve c. Thread A: Increment retrieved value; result is 1. Thread B: Decrement retrieved value; result is -1. Thread A: Store result in c; c is now 1. Thread B: Store result in c; c is now -1. Memory Consistency Errors \u00b6 Memory consistency errors occur when different threads have inconsistent views of what should be the same data. Understanding the cause is difficult, just focus on avoiding them. The key to avoiding memory consistency errors is understanding the happens-before relationship : When a statement invokes Thread.start, every statement that has a happens-before relationship with that statement also has a happens-before relationship with every statement executed by the new thread. The effects of the code that led up to the creation of the new thread are visible to the new thread. When a thread terminates and causes a Thread.join in another thread to return, then all the statements executed by the terminated thread have a happens-before relationship with all the statements following the successful join. The effects of the code in the thread are now visible to the thread that performed the join. Liveness \u00b6 A concurrent application's ability to execute in a timely manner is known as its liveness. Deadlock \u00b6 Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. public class Deadlock { static class Friend { private final String name; public Friend(String name) { this.name = name; } public String getName() { return this.name; } public synchronized void bow(Friend bower) { System.out.format(\"%s: %s\" + \" has bowed to me!%n\", this.name, bower.getName()); bower.bowBack(this); } public synchronized void bowBack(Friend bower) { System.out.format(\"%s: %s\" + \" has bowed back to me!%n\", this.name, bower.getName()); } } public static void main(String[] args) { final Friend alphonse = new Friend(\"Alphonse\"); final Friend gaston = new Friend(\"Gaston\"); new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { alphonse.bow(gaston); } }).start(); new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { gaston.bow(alphonse); } }).start(); } } Starvation \u00b6 Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress. This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by \"greedy\" threads. Livelock \u00b6 A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread, then livelock may result. This is comparable to two people attempting to pass each other in a corridor: Alphonse moves to his left to let Gaston pass, while Gaston moves to his right to let Alphonse pass. Seeing that they are still blocking each other, Alphone moves to his right, while Gaston moves to his left. They're still blocking each other, so.. Guarded Blocks \u00b6 Threads often have to coordinate their actions. The most common coordination idiom is the guarded block. Such a block begins by polling a condition that must be true before the block can proceed. public synchronized void guardedJoy() { while(!joy) { try { wait(); } catch (InterruptedException e) {} } System.out.println(\"Joy and efficiency have been achieved!\"); } Immutable objects \u00b6 An object is considered immutable if its state cannot change after it is constructed. Great for concurrency! The cost of creating a new object vs updating. But this can be optimised by: Decreased overhead due to garbage collection the elimination of code needed to protect mutable objects from corruption. public class SynchronizedRGB { // Values must be between 0 and 255. private int red; private int green; private int blue; private String name; private void check(int red, int green, int blue) { if (red < 0 || red > 255 || green < 0 || green > 255 || blue < 0 || blue > 255) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(); } } public SynchronizedRGB(int red, int green, int blue, String name) { check(red, green, blue); this.red = red; this.green = green; this.blue = blue; this.name = name; } public void set(int red, int green, int blue, String name) { check(red, green, blue); synchronized (this) { this.red = red; this.green = green; this.blue = blue; this.name = name; } } public synchronized int getRGB() { return ((red << 16) | (green << 8) | blue); } public synchronized String getName() { return name; } public synchronized void invert() { red = 255 - red; green = 255 - green; blue = 255 - blue; name = \"Inverse of \" + name; } } SynchronizedRGB color = new SynchronizedRGB(0, 0, 0, \"Pitch Black\"); ... int myColorInt = color.getRGB(); //Statement 1 String myColorName = color.getName(); //Statement 2 If another thread invokes color.set after Statement 1 but before Statement 2, the value of myColorInt won't match the value of myColorName. To avoid this outcome, the two statements must be bound together: synchronized (color) { int myColorInt = color.getRGB(); String myColorName = color.getName(); } This kind of inconsistency is only possible for mutable objects \u2014 it will not be an issue for the immutable version of SynchronizedRGB. Strategy \u00b6 Don't provide \"setter\" methods \u2014 methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields. Make all fields final and private. Don't allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final. A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods. If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed: Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects. Don't share references to the mutable objects. Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor; if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies. Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods. High Level Concurrency Objects \u00b6 Lock Objects \u00b6 Synchronized code relies on a simple kind of reentrant lock. wait/notify mechanism, through their associated Condition objects. The tryLock method backs out if the lock is not available immediately or before a timeout expires (if specified). import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock; import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock; import java.util.Random; public class Safelock { static class Friend { private final String name; private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); public Friend(String name) { this.name = name; } public String getName() { return this.name; } public boolean impendingBow(Friend bower) { Boolean myLock = false; Boolean yourLock = false; try { myLock = lock.tryLock(); yourLock = bower.lock.tryLock(); } finally { if (! (myLock && yourLock)) { if (myLock) { lock.unlock(); } if (yourLock) { bower.lock.unlock(); } } } return myLock && yourLock; } public void bow(Friend bower) { if (impendingBow(bower)) { try { System.out.format(\"%s: %s has\" + \" bowed to me!%n\", this.name, bower.getName()); bower.bowBack(this); } finally { lock.unlock(); bower.lock.unlock(); } } else { System.out.format(\"%s: %s started\" + \" to bow to me, but saw that\" + \" I was already bowing to\" + \" him.%n\", this.name, bower.getName()); } } public void bowBack(Friend bower) { System.out.format(\"%s: %s has\" + \" bowed back to me!%n\", this.name, bower.getName()); } } static class BowLoop implements Runnable { private Friend bower; private Friend bowee; public BowLoop(Friend bower, Friend bowee) { this.bower = bower; this.bowee = bowee; } public void run() { Random random = new Random(); for (;;) { try { Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(10)); } catch (InterruptedException e) {} bowee.bow(bower); } } } public static void main(String[] args) { final Friend alphonse = new Friend(\"Alphonse\"); final Friend gaston = new Friend(\"Gaston\"); new Thread(new BowLoop(alphonse, gaston)).start(); new Thread(new BowLoop(gaston, alphonse)).start(); } } Executors \u00b6 In large-scale applications, it makes sense to separate thread management and creation from the rest of the application. Executor Interfaces \u00b6 Executor a simple interface that supports launching new tasks. The Executor interface provides a single method, execute, designed to be a drop-in replacement for a common thread-creation idiom. replace (new Thread(r)).start(); with e.execute(r); ( r -> Runnable, e -> Executor object) ExecutorService a subinterface of Executor, which adds features that help manage the life cycle, both of the individual tasks and of the executor itself. more versatile submit method. accepts Callable, Runnable objects. which allow the task to return a value. The submit method returns a Future object, which is used to retrieve the Callable return value and to manage the status of both Callable and Runnable tasks. provides methods for submitting large collections of Callable objects. provides a number of methods for managing the shutdown of the executor. ScheduledExecutorService a subinterface of ExecutorService, supports future and/or periodic execution of tasks. schedule, which executes a Runnable or Callable task after a specified delay. scheduleAtFixedRate and scheduleWithFixedDelay, which executes specified tasks repeatedly, at defined intervals. Thread Pools \u00b6 consist of worker threads. Using worker threads minimizes the overhead due to thread creation. fixed thread pool. This type of pool always has a specified number of threads running; applications using it degrade gracefully newFixedThreadPool factory method in java.util.concurrent.Executors: newCachedThreadPool-> executor with an expandable thread pool -> suitable for applications that launch many short-lived tasks. newSingleThreadExecutor -> creates an executor that executes a single task at a time. Several factory methods are ScheduledExecutorService versions of the above executors. java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor Fork/Join \u00b6 Concurrent Collections \u00b6 BlockingQueue defines a first-in-first-out data structure that blocks or times out when you attempt to add to a full queue, or retrieve from an empty queue. ConcurrentMap is a subinterface of java.util.Map that defines useful atomic operations. These operations remove or replace a key-value pair only if the key is present, or add a key-value pair only if the key is absent. Making these operations atomic helps avoid synchronization. The standard general-purpose implementation of ConcurrentMap is ConcurrentHashMap, which is a concurrent analog of HashMap. ConcurrentNavigableMap is a subinterface of ConcurrentMap that supports approximate matches. The standard general-purpose implementation of ConcurrentNavigableMap is ConcurrentSkipListMap, which is a concurrent analog of TreeMap. Atomic Variables \u00b6 The java.util.concurrent.atomic package defines classes that support atomic operations on single variables. All classes have get and set methods that work like reads and writes on volatile variables. That is, a set has a happens-before relationship with any subsequent get on the same variable. The atomic compareAndSet method also has these memory consistency features, as do the simple atomic arithmetic methods that apply to integer atomic variables. import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger; class AtomicCounter { private AtomicInteger c = new AtomicInteger(0); public void increment() { c.incrementAndGet(); } public void decrement() { c.decrementAndGet(); } public int value() { return c.get(); } } Concurrent Random Numbers \u00b6 ThreadLocalRandom -> random numbers from multiple threads or ForkJoinTasks. For concurrent access, using ThreadLocalRandom instead of Math.random() results in less contention and, ultimately, better performance. All you need to do is call ThreadLocalRandom.current(), then call one of its methods to retrieve a random number. Here is one example: int r = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(4, 77); Further Explorations \u00b6 Java Concurrent Animated : Animations that show usage of concurrency features.

The Class class, in the java.lang package, has a large number of methods (more than 50). For example, you can test to see if the class is an annotation (isAnnotation()), an interface (isInterface()), or an enumeration (isEnum()). You can see what the object's fields are (getFields()) or what its methods are (getMethods()), and so on. You can declare some or all of a class's methods final Methods called from constructors should generally be declared finaal. A class that is declared final cannot be subclassed. Abstract Methods and Classes \u00b6 Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. Abstract classes vs interface \u00b6 Abstract classes are similar to interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private concrete methods. With interfaces, all fields are automatically public, static, and final, and all methods that you declare or define (as default methods) are public. In addition, you can extend only one class, whether or not it is abstract, whereas you can implement any number of interfaces. Which should you use, abstract classes or interfaces? Consider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation: You want to share code among several closely related classes. You expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields, or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private). You want to declare non-static or non-final fields. This enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong. Consider using interfaces if any of these statements apply to your situation: You expect that unrelated classes would implement your interface. For example, the interfaces Comparable and Cloneable are implemented by many unrelated classes. You want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behavior. You want to take advantage of multiple inheritance of type. overriding and hiding methods \u00b6 same signature (name, plus the number and the type of its parameters) and return type @Override If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the superclass, then the method in the subclass hides the one in the superclass.

A subclass inherits all of the public and protected members of its parent, no matter what package the subclass is in. If the subclass is in the same package as its parent, it also inherits the package-private members of the parent. You can use the inherited members as is, replace them, hide them, or supplement them with new members: You can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it (not recommended). You can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it. You can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.

This requires a JDBC driver that can communicate with the particular data source being accessed. A user's commands are delivered to the database or other data source, and the results of those statements are sent back to the user. The data source may be located on another machine to which the user is connected via a network. This is referred to as a client/server configuration, with the user's machine as the client, and the machine housing the data source as the server. The network can be an intranet, which, for example, connects employees within a corporation, or it can be the Internet. 3 Tier In the three-tier model, commands are sent to a \"middle tier\" of services, which then sends the commands to the data source. The data source processes the commands and sends the results back to the middle tier, which then sends them to the user. MIS directors find the three-tier model very attractive because the middle tier makes it possible to maintain control over access and the kinds of updates that can be made to corporate data. Another advantage is that it simplifies the deployment of applications. Finally, in many cases, the three-tier architecture can provide performance advantages. Until recently, the middle tier has often been written in languages such as C or C++, which offer fast performance. However, with the introduction of optimizing compilers that translate Java bytecode into efficient machine-specific code and technologies such as Enterprise JavaBeans\u2122, the Java platform is fast becoming the standard platform for middle-tier development. This is a big plus, making it possible to take advantage of Java's robustness, multithreading, and security features. With enterprises increasingly using the Java programming language for writing server code, the JDBC API is being used more and more in the middle tier of a three-tier architecture. Some of the features that make JDBC a server technology are its support for connection pooling, distributed transactions, and disconnected rowsets. The JDBC API is also what allows access to a data source from a Java middle tier. Result Sets and Cursors \u00b6 The rows that satisfy the conditions of a query are called the result set. The number of rows returned in a result set can be zero, one, or many. A user can access the data in a result set one row at a time, and a cursor provides the means to do that. A cursor can be thought of as a pointer into a file that contains the rows of the result set, and that pointer has the ability to keep track of which row is currently being accessed. A cursor allows a user to process each row of a result set from top to bottom and consequently may be used for iterative processing. Most DBMSs create a cursor automatically when a result set is generated. Earlier JDBC API versions added new capabilities for a result set's cursor, allowing it to move both forward and backward and also allowing it to move to a specified row or to a row whose position is relative to another row. Transactions \u00b6 When one user is accessing data in a database, another user may be accessing the same data at the same time. If, for instance, the first user is updating some columns in a table at the same time the second user is selecting columns from that same table, it is possible for the second user to get partly old data and partly updated data. For this reason, DBMSs use transactions to maintain data in a consistent state (data consistency) while allowing more than one user to access a database at the same time (data concurrency). A transaction is a set of one or more SQL statements that make up a logical unit of work. A transaction ends with either a commit or a rollback, depending on whether there are any problems with data consistency or data concurrency. The commit statement makes permanent the changes resulting from the SQL statements in the transaction, and the rollback statement undoes all changes resulting from the SQL statements in the transaction. A lock is a mechanism that prohibits two transactions from manipulating the same data at the same time. For example, a table lock prevents a table from being dropped if there is an uncommitted transaction on that table. In some DBMSs, a table lock also locks all of the rows in a table. A row lock prevents two transactions from modifying the same row, or it prevents one transaction from selecting a row while another transaction is still modifying it. Stored Procedures \u00b6 A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that can be called by name. In other words, it is executable code, a mini-program, that performs a particular task that can be invoked the same way one can call a function or method. Traditionally, stored procedures have been written in a DBMS-specific programming language. The latest generation of database products allows stored procedures to be written using the Java programming language and the JDBC API. Stored procedures written in the Java programming language are bytecode portable between DBMSs. Once a stored procedure is written, it can be used and reused because a DBMS that supports stored procedures will, as its name implies, store it in the database. See Using Stored Procedures for information about writing stored procedures. Metadata \u00b6 Databases store user data, and they also store information about the database itself. Most DBMSs have a set of system tables, which list tables in the database, column names in each table, primary keys, foreign keys, stored procedures, and so forth. Each DBMS has its own functions for getting information about table layouts and database features. JDBC provides the interface DatabaseMetaData, which a driver writer must implement so that its methods return information about the driver and/or DBMS for which the driver is written. For example, a large number of methods return whether or not the driver supports a particular functionality. This interface gives users and tools a standardized way to get metadata. In general, developers writing tools and drivers are the ones most likely to be concerned with metadata.

Although it depends on the system, PHP typically uses the IEEE 754 double precision format, which will give a maximum relative error due to rounding in the order of 1.11e-16. Non elementary arithmetic operations may give larger errors, and, of course, error propagation must be considered when several operations are compounded. Additionally, rational numbers that are exactly representable as floating point numbers in base 10, like 0.1 or 0.7, do not have an exact representation as floating point numbers in base 2, which is used internally, no matter the size of the mantissa. Hence, they cannot be converted into their internal binary counterparts without a small loss of precision. This can lead to confusing results: for example, floor((0.1+0.7)*10) will usually return 7 instead of the expected 8, since the internal representation will be something like 7.9999999999999991118.... So never trust floating number results to the last digit, and do not compare floating point numbers directly for equality. If higher precision is necessary, the arbitrary precision math functions and gmp functions are available.

Although it depends on the system, PHP typically uses the IEEE 754 double precision format, which will give a maximum relative error due to rounding in the order of 1.11e-16. Non elementary arithmetic operations may give larger errors, and, of course, error propagation must be considered when several operations are compounded. Additionally, rational numbers that are exactly representable as floating point numbers in base 10, like 0.1 or 0.7, do not have an exact representation as floating point numbers in base 2, which is used internally, no matter the size of the mantissa. Hence, they cannot be converted into their internal binary counterparts without a small loss of precision. This can lead to confusing results: for example, floor((0.1+0.7)*10) will usually return 7 instead of the expected 8, since the internal representation will be something like 7.9999999999999991118.... So never trust floating number results to the last digit, and do not compare floating point numbers directly for equality.
