# Facade

Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

### When?

* Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
* Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.


| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
|You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.|A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.|
