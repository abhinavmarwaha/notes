# Prototype

lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### When?

* Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
* Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects. Somebody could have created these subclasses to be able to create objects with a specific configuration.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
|You can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.|Cloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.|
|You can get rid of repeated initialization code in favor of cloning pre-built prototypes.|     |
|You can produce complex objects more conveniently.|    |
|You get an alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets for complex objects.|    |
