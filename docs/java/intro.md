# What is Java?

[javase/tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

Java is Object oriented by design.

| Procedural                           | Object-Oriented                        |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Programs are divided into procedures | Into objects                           |
| Focus: procedure                     | Data                                   |
| Data moves throughout the program.   | Object communicates                    |
| none                                 | Data hiding, polymorphism, inheritance |

### programming language

* general-purpose
* high-level 

.java -> compiler -> .class (byte code) -> JVM (interpreter) -> machine code

perform additional steps at runtime to give your application a performance boost.
finding performance bottlenecks and recompiling (to native code) frequently used sections of code.

Simple
Object oriented
Distributed
Multithreaded
Dynamic
Architecture neutral
Portable
High performance
Robust
Secure

### Platform

A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.
Java platform a software-only platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms.

* JVM
* Java API

* Development Tools - javac, java, javadoc etc
* API - basic objects, networking, security, XML generation, database access etc
* Deployment Technologies - Java Web Start and Java Plug-In for deploying your applications to end users.
* User Interface Toolkits -  JavaFX, Swing, and Java 2D (GUI)
* Integration Libraries - database access and manipulation of remote objects. (IDL, JDBC, JNDI, RMI, RMI-IIOP)

platform-independent environment

### Why?

* *Get started quickly*: powerful object-oriented language, it's easy to learn.
* *less code*: 4 times smaller than the same program written in C++. (based on methods, classes count etc)
* *better code*: good coding practices, automatic garbage collection, object orientation, JavaBeans™ component architecture, API
* *Develop more quickly*: 2x c++
* *portable*
* *Write once, run anywhere*
* *Distribute software easily*: With Java Web Start software.

### JEE vs JSE

Java™ Standard Edition (Java™ SE ) and the Java™ Enterprise Edition (Java™ EE).
