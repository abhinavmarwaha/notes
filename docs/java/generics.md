bugs are difficult to find. with generics you can detect some runtime bugs at compile time.
generics enable types to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods. 

# Why?

* Stronger type checks at compile time.
* Elimination of casts
* Enabling programmers to implement generic algorithms.
