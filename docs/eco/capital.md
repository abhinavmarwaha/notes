Capital

    Capital goods are good that are not for consumption, but for the production of other goods. Higher order goods.
    Nothing inherent to goods makes them capital goods. It's subjective, dependent on how a person uses it.The same good can be used as a capital or consumption good.
    Human reason inevitably discovers capital and uses it to increase the quantity and value of its time.
    If humans are able to meet their current needs, they can save some of their resources for the future. Postponing consumption makes it possible to provide for the future. Provision for the future makes it possible to engage in production processes that are longer and more productive.
    Starting point of capital accumulation is the provision of consumption goods for the period of production. I.e. The starting point for building a fishing rod is the provision of fish for the time spent building the fishing rod rather than fishing.

    The opportunity cost of capital is always consumption.

    When producing using capital goods, you are producing at a higher productivity: higher output per unit of time.
    Capital goods are created to increase productivity. Time is spent on longer processes of production to achieve higher outputs per unit of time. (1) they may provide a greater production of the same good per unit of time; or (2) they may allow the actor to consume goods that are not available at all with shorter processes of production.
    Capital requires saving: the deferral of consumption. Delayed gratification. The opportunity cost of capital is in terms of consumption goods, ultimately. Productive goods can be sold for consumption goods. Sacrifice is necessarily involved, because resources can always be redirected to satisfy immediate needs. Not easy!

    The constraint on capital accumulation is time preference.

    The price of capital is determined by time preference.Time preference means there is a preference for present goods over future goods, it determines the originary interest.
    Originary interest is the ratio of the value assigned to a present good and the value assigned to an identical future good.
    The loan market adjusts the interest rate on loans to be equal the rate of originary interest, as manifested in the rate of discount future goods.
    Interest rate and time preference is discussed in more detail in chapter XIX of Human Action, and Chapter 6 of Man, Economy, and State. It will also be discussed in more detail in the second Principles of Economics course offered on saifedean.com, ECO12).
    Since time preference is positive, only the expectation of a real return encourages saving. Only investment in activities which offer a positive return is undertaken.
    Capital is only accumulated in processes of production that are longer and more productive. Lenders will only lend if offered a return that compensates them for forgoing present goods.
    Capital raises the marginal productivity of labor. If it didn't, it wouldn't be capital, it'd be a consumption good. Only capital that raises productivity can pay back the saver.
    You build a fishing rod, then a net, then a boat. Any capital that doesn't increase productivity is discarded or repurposed. The process continues to get longer, but only with additions that increase productivity.
    The loan market only provides capital to projects that make enough return to compensate lenders enough to overcome their originary interest.
    Productivity rises as the process gets longer.
    Accumulating capital leads to the increase of the total period of production of higher goods, but a decrease of the period for the production of each unit.
    Catching a fish with your bare hands takes longer per fish than a fishing rod, but it is shorter as an overall process than manufacturing the fishing rod and using it.
    The value of capital goods is derived purely from the value of the consumer goods they provide.
    As capital is accumulated, newer technologies are developed for its application.
    As time goes by, people accumulate more capital, time preference begins to drop further, and the price of capital drops further.
