Labor

* Wanting leisure is a natural consequence of positive time preference. But humans don't just want to increasing the value of their time. They also want to increase the amount of time they have. Survival in the long run requires work and that incentivizes the lowering of time preference.

Reason inevitably leads to an understanding that work can increase the life span of a human, and prevent death. This causes the progressive lowering of time preference.

    Man realizes he can catch a fish and eat it.
    You can't just lie down on the beach forever. You start getting hungry and you realize you can catch a fish that will end your hunger. You start acting. You work for the fish.
    The employment of the physiological functions and manifestations of human life as a means is called labor. Employing time in doing things that we don't value for their own sake, but for the outcomes they provide us.
    Labor is our first tool for increasing the amount and value of our time. All animals employ this. Unlike animals, we have others!
