Technology

    Reason allows us to develop concepts and ideas we use to achieve economic outcomes. Technology can be thought of as the plan of economic action, and the mechanism by which man achieves his ends. Similar to a recipe.
    Technological advancement is the development and application of better ideas and methods of production, leading to an increase in output per unit of time.
    You develop new ways of catching fish. A better fishing rod, a stronger boat. You catch fish you couldn't catch before.
    Technology is a form of capital. It also serves to increase productivity of labor. It is distinct from physical capital in that it is non-rival. One person using a technology does not reduce its usefulness to others. One person invented the wheel, billions have used it.
    Everything created by humans starts as an idea.
    It has the enormous advantage of not being physical. It is much harder to stop and control by governments. Improvements in technology are more likely to improve economic outcomes today because capital accumulation is easier to control and restrict by governments.
    Many Austrian Economists believe that patent laws, intellectual property, World Trade Organization are all actively preventing the spread of ideas and trying to minimize the number of people that benefit from them. But the internet is stronger than all of them!
    See: Kinsella, Against Intellectual Property: https://nakamotoinstitute.org/literature/against-ip/
    Kramer's paper shows that areas with higher population density grow faster than lower population density in the long run. Because the driver of growth is not rival resources, but non-rival ideas. More people means more non-rival ideas, more productivity.
    Ideas are the one thing that cannot be controlled. Nobody can control what you think, no matter what they do. All the world's armies cannot kill a thought.
