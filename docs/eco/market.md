# Market

* **Law of demand**: As price increases, the quantity demanded decreases.
* **Law of supply**: As price increases, the quantity supplied increases.
* The price point at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded is the **equilibrium price**.
* It's better to think of the 'equilibrating process' instead of a fixed equilibrium. 
* The world is not fixed, it is constantly evolving and changing, and changes are constantly affecting the market. 
* Equilibrium is, in a sense, **never reached**. 
* But the drive to equilibrium is constantly altering prices. 
* When QS > QD we get a surplus and a tendency for prices to **fall**. 
* When QD > QS, we get a shortage and a tendency for prices to **rise**.
* **Speculation** is what ensures that the prices clear and equilibrium is reached.
* Prices of factors of production are also determined based on consumer demand.
* The discounted marginal value product (**DMVP**) of a factor of production is the additional revenue this factor contributes to the business employing it, discounted to its present value.
* Entrepreneurs will pay for an additional unit of labor, capital, or land as long as it costs less than its DMVP.
* If hiring an additional worker for a day will add $10 of revenue to a business, that business will hire an additional worker if their wage demand is less than $10 per day.
* If an entrepreneur is considering buying a machine that costs $1,000, he will buy it if the discounted marginal value product it produces over its lifetime is greater than $1,000.
* Ultimately, it is the consumers' valuation of final goods that gives value to factors of production.
* The function of the entrepreneur is to pay for the factors of production before production has taken place, taking on the risk that consumers won't value it enough.
* The value of factors of production, including labor, is only determined through the subjective valuation of consumers. \
* It is futile to complain about wages or returns on capital. 
* These are vital signals from the market telling individuals how valuable their labor, land, and capital are.
* Entrepreneurs simply cannot decide wages for themselves and are **slaves of the subjective valuations of consumers**.
* If they decide to overpay for wages, they will lose their profitability and be replaced by entrepreneurs who pay the correct price.
* If the entrepreneur decides to pay a lower wage, he would lose his workers to others who will pay them more.
* Entrepreneurs and capitalists cannot oppress workers in a free market system, because workers can always **leave** to a competitor, or start their own businesses.
* **The consumer is king.**
* Individuals are only sovereign in a market economy in their capacity as consumers.
* Producers are subordinate to the desires of consumers.
* The market economy has steadily increased the real wages of workers, because the market economy is constantly finding new ways of increasing the value of human time.
* Is the market a democracy? No. It's much better!
