# Time 

* Human action is a process that occurs across time.
* Being irreversible, time is a unique good.
* Time is an economic good, because it is scarce.
* Opportunity cost exists because time is scarce.
* Economics is ultimately about economizing the amount and **subjective value** of our time on earth.
* Economic scarcity is really the scarcity of time.
* human time can be used to make all other resources.
* **real** prices of metals are constantly declining. In terms of human time, all resources keep getting cheaper.


* Time on earth being finite means we always have a time preference: universal preference for earlier over later goods.
* Time preference is always positive. 
* Utility today is always preferred to the same utility tomorrow. Individuals always prefer consuming or having a good today over next year.
* Security of property rights allows for time preference to drop. Natural disasters or crime increase it. But humans can defend against these. Government predation is systemic and harder to defend against.
* People value their time, and would like to spend it in good ways. People like good times, or leisure.
* You want your scarce time on earth to be long and subjectively valuable. Ideally you want to be spending it doing things you enjoy. Things you want to do, not things you have to do.
* Wanting leisure is a natural consequence of positive time preference. Wanting to enjoy life now.
* But... Living long and well requires provision. It needs food and shelter and many other scarce goods. The desire to live long creates a lower time preference.
* Man's reason leads him to realize he can provide for himself and improve his situation.
* Everyone would like to spend all their life in leisure. But since we are not eternal creatures living in the garden of Eden, too much leisure will inevitably mean an early death through starvation or the violent vagaries of nature. We cannot just enjoy leisure indefinitely, because we are always capable of conceiving of ways in which we can **improve the quality and quantity of time we have on earth**.
