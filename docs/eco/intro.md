### Goods

Satisfaction of our **Needs**

Prerequisites for a thing becoming a good:

* need
* satisfaction
* Human knowledge of this causal connection.
* Command of the thing sufficient to direct it to the satisfaction of the need.

### Economic goods

* scarcity
* demand > supply
* Scarcity makes us value goods

### Economics is the study of human choices under scarcity

* disparity between what we want and we have

### Opportunity Cost

* Human time is limited
* Every economic choice involves most valuable alternative forgone.

### Economizing

* Wealth: The entire sum of economic goods at an economizing individualâ€™s command.

### Value

* Non-economic goods have utility but no value.
* Economic goods have utility and value.
* Scarcity means we have to value goods, and make choices between them.

### Value is subjective

* Value cannot exist outside human valuation and choices, reflecting humans' own preferences and valuations.
* This means it is ordinal, not cardinal.
* Ordinal valuation: valuing objects in relation to one another.

### Free Exchange and Subjective Value

* Trade only happens when individuals exchange things at different valuations.
* Austrians believe value is subjective.

### Marginalism

* The value of the good at any point in time is equal to the value of the least important need it fulfills. 
* The value relevant to your choice of a good is the value of the last need it fulfills.

### Law of diminishing marginal utility

The marginal utility declines with each extra unit of a good.
