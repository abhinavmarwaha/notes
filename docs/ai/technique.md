# Techniques

AI technique is a method that exploits
knowledge that should be represenetd in such
a way that:

* generalizations.
* understood by provdors (people)
* It can easily be modified to correct errors
* reflect changes in the world.
* It can be used in many situations even if it is not totally accurate or complete.
* It can be used to narrow the range of possibilities

### Metrics

* complexity
* use of generalizations
* clarity of knowledge
* extensibility of the approach

### AI Problem Features

* symbolic reasoning
* A focus on problems that do not respond to algorithmic solutions.
* Heuristic search
* Manipulate the significant quantitative features of a situation rather than relying on numeric methods.
* semantic meaning
* Answer that are neither exact nor optimal but “sufficient”.
* Domain specific knowledge
* meta-level knowledge

### Criteria for Success

* **long term**: Turing Test (for Weak AI)
  * Loebner Prize competition, extremely controversial
* **short term**: more modest success in limited domains
  * performance equal or better than humans
  * real-world practicality
  * expert systems (XCON, Prospector), fuzzy logic (cruise control)

### Turing Test
