We have studied the strategies which can reason either in forward or
backward, but a mixture of the two directions is appropriate for solving
a complex and large problem. Such a mixed strategy, make it possible
that first to solve the major part of a problem and then go back and
solve the small problems arise during combining the big parts of the
problem. Such a technique is called Means-Ends Analysis. • Means-Ends Analysis is problem-solving techniques used in Artificial
intelligence for limiting search in AI programs.
• It is a mixture of Backward and forward search technique. • The MEA technique was first introduced in 1961 by Allen Newell, and
Herbert A. Simon in their problem-solving computer program, which
was named as General Problem Solver (GPS).
• The MEA analysis process centered on the evaluation of the difference
between the current state and goal state.
