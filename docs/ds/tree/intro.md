# Tree

* Hierarchal DS

```
      ----
       j    <-- root
     /   \
    f      k  
  /   \      \
 a     h      z    <-- leaves 
```

* f, k -> siblings.
* k is parent of z, z is child of k.

### why? 

* need hierarchal structure!  eg - file system.
* moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays)
* moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than *Unordered* Linked Lists).
* no limit like linked list.

### Applications

1. Manipulate hierarchical data.
2. Make information easy to search aka tree traversal.
3. Manipulate sorted lists of data.
4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects.
5. Router algorithms
6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).
